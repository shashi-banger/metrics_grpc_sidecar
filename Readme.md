# Metrics GRPC Sidecar

This repository implements an application with GRPC interface to register 
metrics and to instrument metrics. The application provides a `/metrics` 
endpoint where the metrics can be pulled. This application uses
 [prometheus golang client](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus#section-readme)
